---

## 1. Goal

Build a production-grade, memory-safe, programmable telephony engine in Rust that can terminate and originate SIP calls, negotiate media using SDP, send and receive RTP/RTCP, handle DTMF and common call-control operations, and expose a clean API/event interface for AI voice applications.

The system should be designed around the needs of modern AI voice infrastructure rather than traditional PBX functionality.

The target architecture is:

```text
SIP Carrier / PSTN / PBX
          |
          v
+--------------------------+
|      Rust SIP Core       |
| transactions / dialogs   |
| auth / routing / SDP     |
+------------+-------------+

             +--------------------------+
             |                          |
             v                          v
+----------------------+     +----------------------+
| AI Media Interface   |     | SIP / PSTN Transfer  |
| WebSocket / RTP etc. |     | secondary call leg   |
+----------+-----------+     +----------------------+
           |
           v
+--------------------------+
| STT / LLM / TTS / Agent  |
| external application     |
+--------------------------+
```

The project is **not** intended to be a complete Rust rewrite of Asterisk.

It should implement only the telephony primitives required by AI voice applications and expose them through simple programmable interfaces.

---

# 2. Why This Project Exists

Asterisk is an extremely capable telephony platform, but its architecture and feature surface are substantially broader than what is required for an AI voice platform.

Our requirements are primarily:

- receive SIP calls;
- originate SIP calls;
- authenticate with SIP providers;
- negotiate audio;
- receive and send audio;
- stream media to/from an AI application;
- detect and generate DTMF;
- record calls;
- transfer calls;
- bridge call legs;
- expose call lifecycle events;
- terminate calls safely;
- operate reliably at high concurrency.

Asterisk additionally contains decades of PBX functionality that we do not need to reproduce.

Examples include:

- voicemail;
- traditional dialplans;
- large PBX feature sets;
- legacy channel drivers;
- extensive conferencing functionality;
- numerous database integrations;
- legacy telephony hardware support;
- compatibility modules unrelated to our product;
- arbitrary in-process modules.

The new system should therefore be substantially smaller, easier to reason about, easier to test, and safer to expose to untrusted network traffic.

---

# 3. Core Design Principle

The project should be treated as:

> **A memory-safe programmable SIP + RTP engine for AI voice applications.**

It should **not** be treated as:

> Asterisk rewritten in Rust.

This distinction is fundamental.

Whenever an Asterisk feature is considered for implementation, the default question must be:

> Does an AI voice application actually require this capability?

If not, do not implement it.

---

# 4. Primary Objectives

## 4.1 Memory Safety

Network-facing protocol processing should be implemented in safe Rust wherever practical.

The following components should preferably contain no C/C++ parser dependency:

- SIP message parsing;
- SIP transaction processing;
- SIP dialog state;
- SDP parsing;
- RTP packet parsing;
- RTCP packet parsing;
- DTMF/RFC 4733 processing;
- STUN parsing, if implemented;
- WebSocket control/media framing.

`unsafe` Rust should be minimized and isolated.

Any `unsafe` block must:

1. be contained within a narrow module;
2. document why unsafe code is required;
3. document the invariants that make it safe;
4. include targeted tests;
5. undergo explicit review.

---

## 4.2 Programmability

The server should be controlled through APIs rather than an Asterisk-style dialplan.

Applications should be able to perform operations similar to:

```http
POST /v1/calls
```

```json
{
  "from": "+14155550123",
  "to": "+919876543210",
  "route": "provider-a",
  "media": {
    "mode": "websocket",
    "url": "wss://voice.example.com/session"
  }
}
```

The system should expose lifecycle events such as:

```text
call.created
call.invite_received
call.ringing
call.early_media
call.answered
media.started
dtmf.received
call.transferring
call.transferred
call.hangup
call.failed
```

The control plane should remain independent from the media plane.

---

## 4.3 High-Concurrency Media Processing

The RTP/media path should be optimized for:

- predictable memory use;
- bounded buffering;
- low allocation rates;
- backpressure;
- minimal copying;
- high concurrency;
- graceful degradation;
- observable packet loss and jitter.

The implementation should avoid architectures in which one slow downstream AI service can create unbounded queues inside the telephony server.

---

## 4.4 Operational Simplicity

The engine should be deployable as a normal Linux service/container.

Initial deployment targets:

- Linux;
- OCI/Docker-compatible container;
- Kubernetes-compatible deployment;
- bare-metal or VM deployment.

The core server should not depend on an external runtime such as Node.js, JVM, or Python.

---

# 5. Non-Goals

The first versions should explicitly **not** attempt to reproduce the complete Asterisk feature set.

Unless later justified by product requirements, the following are non-goals:

- complete PBX functionality;
- Asterisk dialplan compatibility;
- `extensions.conf` compatibility;
- `AMI` compatibility;
- `AGI` compatibility;
- `ARI` compatibility;
- voicemail;
- call-center queue management;
- arbitrary Asterisk module compatibility;
- analog telephony hardware;
- ISDN hardware;
- DAHDI;
- legacy channel drivers;
- arbitrary codec transcoding;
- full SIP RFC feature coverage from day one;
- SIP proxy functionality comparable to Kamailio/OpenSIPS;
- carrier-grade SBC functionality in the first release;
- complete WebRTC browser support in the first release;
- implementing every SIP extension supported by Asterisk.

---

# 6. Required Protocol Surface

## 6.1 SIP

The first production-capable release should support the SIP methods required by our actual providers and call flows.

Minimum expected methods:

```text
INVITE
ACK
BYE
CANCEL
OPTIONS
```

Where required:

```text
REGISTER
REFER
NOTIFY
INFO
UPDATE
PRACK
```

Do not implement optional methods only because they exist in the SIP specification. Add them when a real interoperability requirement exists.

---

## 6.2 SIP Transport

Initial transports:

- UDP;
- TCP.

Production roadmap:

- TLS;
- SIP over WebSocket only if required.

The transport subsystem should not own call state.

Transport, transaction, dialog, and application layers should remain separated.

---

# 7. SIP Architecture

The SIP implementation should use explicit layers.

```text
Network
   |
   v
Transport
   |
   v
Parser
   |
   v
Transaction Layer
   |
   v
Dialog Layer
   |
   v
Call State Machine
   |
   v
Application / Routing
```

## 7.1 Transport Layer

Responsible for:

- UDP sockets;
- TCP connections;
- TLS connections;
- connection lifecycle;
- rate limits;
- packet size limits;
- source metadata.

It must not contain business routing logic.

---

## 7.2 Parser

Responsible for turning bytes into validated SIP messages.

Requirements:

- reject malformed messages safely;
- enforce configurable message-size limits;
- enforce configurable header limits;
- avoid recursive parsing;
- avoid uncontrolled allocations;
- preserve unknown headers where required;
- support fuzz testing independently from the server.

The parser must never panic on arbitrary network input.

---

## 7.3 Transaction Layer

Implement SIP transaction state independently from call state.

Examples include:

```text
INVITE client transaction
INVITE server transaction
non-INVITE client transaction
non-INVITE server transaction
```

Retransmission timers should follow the relevant SIP RFC behavior.

Timer handling must be testable with deterministic/mock time.

---

## 7.4 Dialog Layer

The dialog layer should track:

- Call-ID;
- local tag;
- remote tag;
- local sequence;
- remote sequence;
- route set;
- remote target;
- dialog state.

A dialog should not be identified by Call-ID alone.

---

# 8. Call State Machine

Call state should be explicit.

Example high-level state model:

```text
Created
   |
   v
Inviting
   |
   +--> Early
   |      |
   |      v
   |   Ringing
   |      |
   +------+ 
          v
       Answered
          |
          v
        Active
          |
     +----+----+
     |         |
     v         v
Transferring  Ending
     |         |
     +----+----+
          v
       Ended
```

Additional states may exist internally.

State transitions must be validated.

Impossible transitions should return errors rather than silently mutating call state.

The implementation should support deterministic state-machine unit tests.

---

# 9. SDP

The server must support SDP negotiation for audio calls.

Initial requirements:

- parse remote SDP;
- generate local SDP;
- negotiate codecs;
- negotiate RTP endpoints;
- handle `sendrecv`;
- handle `sendonly`;
- handle `recvonly`;
- handle `inactive`;
- handle telephone-event payloads;
- process updated SDP during re-INVITEs where supported.

SDP parsing must be independently fuzzable.

---

# 10. Codecs

Initial mandatory codecs:

- PCMU / G.711 μ-law;
- PCMA / G.711 A-law.

Likely additional codec:

- Opus.

Codec support should be modular.

Avoid implementing codec algorithms ourselves when mature, audited implementations already exist.

Native codec libraries may be used behind narrow FFI boundaries where appropriate.

The network-facing protocol parser should remain in Rust even if codec implementation uses native libraries.

---

# 11. RTP

The media engine is a first-class subsystem and must not be implemented as an afterthought.

It should support:

- RTP packet parsing;
- RTP packet serialization;
- sequence numbers;
- timestamps;
- SSRC tracking;
- payload type mapping;
- packet-loss tracking;
- jitter metrics;
- configurable buffering;
- source validation;
- media inactivity detection.

The server should be able to process audio without performing transcoding where both sides share a compatible codec.

---

# 12. RTCP

RTCP support should include at least the subset necessary for media quality observability.

Track:

- packets sent;
- packets received;
- packets lost;
- jitter;
- round-trip estimates where available;
- SSRC changes.

Expose media statistics through metrics and call diagnostics.

---

# 13. DTMF

Support RTP telephone events according to RFC 4733 / RFC 2833 conventions.

Required functionality:

- receive DTMF;
- emit application events;
- generate DTMF;
- validate event durations;
- deduplicate repeated packets representing the same event.

SIP INFO DTMF may be implemented when required by a provider.

---

# 14. AI Media Interface

Connecting telephony audio to AI applications is a primary feature.

The first implementation should support at least one bidirectional streaming mechanism.

Recommended initial interface:

```text
WebSocket
```

Potential later interfaces:

- RTP;
- WebRTC;
- Unix socket;
- gRPC streaming;
- shared memory for colocated workloads.

A media session should expose:

```text
call_id
stream_id
direction
codec
sample_rate
timestamps
```

Example conceptual stream:

```text
SIP caller
   |
   | RTP
   v
Rust Media Core
   |
   | normalized audio frames
   v
WebSocket
   |
   v
AI Voice Runtime
   |
   +--> STT
   +--> LLM
   +--> TTS
   |
   | generated audio
   v
Rust Media Core
   |
   | RTP
   v
SIP caller
```

---

# 15. Backpressure

Backpressure must be explicitly designed.

The system must never allow an unresponsive AI application to create an unlimited audio queue.

Each media stream should have configurable bounded queues.

When limits are exceeded, the system should apply a defined policy such as:

- drop oldest audio;
- drop newest audio;
- terminate the media stream;
- terminate the call;
- switch to fallback behavior.

The behavior must be observable.

---

# 16. Recording

The system should optionally support recording.

Initial requirements:

- caller channel;
- agent channel;
- mixed recording where required;
- timestamped recording metadata.

Recording should not block the real-time media path.

Storage backends should be external to the SIP core.

---

# 17. Call Bridging

Support bridging two media legs.

Primary scenarios:

```text
SIP caller <-> AI agent
```

and:

```text
SIP caller <-> human SIP/PSTN destination
```

A bridge should be able to switch between AI and human destinations without requiring a new inbound call.

---

# 18. Call Transfer

Support transfers required by AI escalation workflows.

Initial priority:

- server-initiated outbound second leg;
- bridge caller to human destination.

Later:

- SIP REFER;
- attended transfer;
- blind transfer.

Do not depend exclusively on provider-specific REFER behavior for critical escalation flows.

---

# 19. NAT

The implementation must account for common NAT scenarios.

At minimum:

- configurable advertised SIP address;
- configurable advertised RTP address;
- symmetric RTP learning where appropriate;
- source-address validation;
- private/public address handling.

STUN/TURN/ICE should be introduced only if required by deployment scenarios.

---

# 20. Security

The SIP server is an internet-facing security boundary.

Security requirements include:

- safe Rust for network parsers;
- maximum SIP message size;
- maximum header count;
- maximum header length;
- rate limiting;
- authentication failure throttling;
- transaction limits;
- connection limits;
- call concurrency limits;
- RTP source validation;
- configurable IP allow/deny lists;
- secure credential storage;
- TLS support;
- structured audit logs.

No panic caused by malformed network input should terminate the server process.

---

# 21. SIP Authentication

Where required, support SIP Digest authentication.

Credentials must:

- never appear in normal logs;
- never appear in metrics;
- support runtime rotation where practical;
- be represented using secret-aware configuration types.

---

# 22. API

The application API should be conceptually similar to programmable telephony providers rather than a PBX dialplan.

Possible endpoints:

```text
POST   /v1/calls
GET    /v1/calls/{call_id}
DELETE /v1/calls/{call_id}

POST   /v1/calls/{call_id}/answer
POST   /v1/calls/{call_id}/hangup
POST   /v1/calls/{call_id}/dtmf
POST   /v1/calls/{call_id}/transfer
POST   /v1/calls/{call_id}/recordings
```

Exact API design should be specified separately.

---

# 23. Event Interface

Events should be available through one or more of:

- webhooks;
- WebSocket;
- message queue;
- internal Rust subscription API.

Events must contain stable IDs.

Example:

```json
{
  "event": "call.answered",
  "event_id": "evt_...",
  "call_id": "call_...",
  "timestamp": "2026-08-30T10:00:00Z",
  "data": {}
}
```

Delivery semantics must be documented.

If webhooks are used, retries and idempotency must be supported.

---

# 24. Stable Internal Identifiers

Do not use SIP Call-ID as the primary application identifier.

Create independent identifiers such as:

```text
call_...
leg_...
stream_...
recording_...
event_...
```

Maintain mappings to protocol identifiers internally.

---

# 25. Observability

Every call should be diagnosable without enabling packet-level debug logs globally.

Structured logs should include:

```text
call_id
leg_id
sip_call_id
direction
provider
remote_address
state
method
response_code
codec
rtp_local_address
rtp_remote_address
hangup_reason
duration
```

Secrets and authentication headers must be redacted.

---

# 26. Metrics

Expose Prometheus-compatible metrics.

Important metrics include:

```text
sip_requests_total
sip_responses_total
sip_parse_errors_total
sip_active_dialogs
calls_active
calls_started_total
calls_answered_total
calls_failed_total
calls_completed_total

rtp_packets_received_total
rtp_packets_sent_total
rtp_packets_lost_total
rtp_invalid_packets_total
rtp_jitter
media_streams_active

media_queue_depth
media_frames_dropped_total

websocket_media_connections
websocket_media_errors_total
```

Metrics cardinality must be controlled.

Do not use phone numbers or call IDs as Prometheus labels.

---

# 27. Distributed Tracing

Where practical, support OpenTelemetry.

A call trace should allow correlation across:

```text
SIP engine
     |
media stream
     |
AI gateway
     |
STT
     |
LLM
     |
TTS
```

The internal `call_id` should be propagated as correlation metadata.

---

# 28. Error Model

Avoid unstructured string errors across subsystem boundaries.

Errors should have stable categories, for example:

```text
SipParseError
SipTransactionTimeout
SipAuthenticationFailure
SipRemoteRejected
SdpNegotiationFailure
UnsupportedCodec
RtpTimeout
MediaBackpressure
AiMediaDisconnected
TransferFailure
InternalError
```

Errors exposed through APIs should include stable machine-readable codes.

---

# 29. Concurrency Model

Use a design that prevents shared mutable global call state.

Possible design:

```text
one call actor/task
       |
       +-- SIP state
       +-- media state
       +-- timers
       +-- event channel
```

The exact implementation may use Tokio tasks, actors, or another model, but ownership boundaries should remain clear.

Prefer message passing over large shared lock-protected state structures.

---

# 30. Resource Limits

All potentially attacker-controlled resource growth must be bounded.

Examples:

- SIP message size;
- number of headers;
- TCP connections;
- dialogs per source;
- transactions per source;
- concurrent calls;
- RTP queue size;
- WebSocket queue size;
- event queue size;
- recording buffer size.

A load test should verify memory remains bounded under overload.

---

# 31. Graceful Shutdown

On shutdown:

1. stop accepting new calls;
2. stop originating new calls;
3. optionally allow active calls to complete for a configured grace period;
4. terminate remaining calls cleanly;
5. flush telemetry;
6. close sockets.

Deployments must be possible without abruptly terminating every active call.

---

# 32. Configuration

Configuration should support:

- static configuration file;
- environment variables;
- secret injection.

Example conceptual configuration:

```toml
[sip]
listen_udp = "0.0.0.0:5060"
listen_tcp = "0.0.0.0:5060"
advertised_address = "sip.example.com"

[rtp]
port_min = 20000
port_max = 30000
advertised_address = "203.0.113.10"

[limits]
max_calls = 10000
max_sip_message_bytes = 65535

[api]
listen = "0.0.0.0:8080"
```

Configuration must be validated before the server begins accepting traffic.

---

# 33. Carrier Abstraction

Provider quirks should not leak throughout the SIP engine.

Use provider-specific compatibility policies when necessary.

Example:

```text
ProviderProfile
   |
   +-- authentication behavior
   +-- header rewriting
   +-- supported codecs
   +-- early-media behavior
   +-- transfer behavior
   +-- NAT behavior
```

Keep the standards-compliant implementation as the default.

Provider-specific workarounds should be explicit and tested.

---

# 34. Interoperability Is a Core Risk

The largest engineering risk is not Rust.

It is SIP interoperability.

Real providers may use or require:

- early media;
- `183 Session Progress`;
- `100rel`;
- PRACK;
- UPDATE;
- re-INVITE;
- session timers;
- Record-Route;
- Contact rewriting;
- NAT behavior;
- multiple provisional responses;
- retransmissions;
- late ACK;
- CANCEL/200/487 races;
- REFER;
- unusual SDP;
- codec changes;
- malformed-but-tolerated SIP.

Asterisk has decades of interoperability experience.

The project must replace that experience with systematic testing rather than assumptions.

---

# 35. Packet Capture Corpus

Build an internal sanitized PCAP/SIP corpus from real call flows.

Include successful and unsuccessful examples across every provider.

Examples:

```text
inbound answered call
outbound answered call
busy
declined
no answer
early media
remote hangup
local hangup
authentication failure
codec mismatch
re-INVITE
transfer
DTMF
network loss
provider timeout
```

Personally identifiable information and credentials must be sanitized.

These captures should become regression fixtures.

---

# 36. Replay Testing

Build tooling capable of replaying SIP scenarios deterministically.

Conceptually:

```text
PCAP / fixture
      |
      v
Scenario replay
      |
      v
Rust SIP engine
      |
      v
Expected transaction/dialog/call state
```

This should allow previously observed provider behavior to become permanent regression coverage.

---

# 37. Fuzzing

Fuzzing is mandatory.

Use tools such as `cargo-fuzz` against:

- SIP parser;
- SIP header parser;
- SDP parser;
- RTP parser;
- RTCP parser;
- STUN parser if present;
- DTMF parser;
- URI parser.

Minimum property:

> Arbitrary input must not panic, corrupt memory, or cause unbounded allocation.

Fuzzing should run continuously or on a scheduled CI job.

---

# 38. Property-Based Testing

Use property-based testing for protocol invariants.

Examples:

```text
parse(serialize(message)) == message
```

where normalization permits.

Other properties:

- invalid state transitions fail;
- sequence number rollover is handled;
- RTP timestamp rollover is handled;
- duplicate SIP retransmissions do not create duplicate calls;
- duplicate DTMF packets do not generate duplicate logical events.

---

# 39. Integration Testing

Automated tests should cover interoperability with:

- Asterisk;
- at least one major SIP provider used by us;
- SIPp;
- our AI media service.

SIPp should be used for deterministic protocol scenarios and load generation.

---

# 40. Differential Testing Against Asterisk

During migration, Asterisk can act as an oracle for expected behavior.

For a scenario:

```text
same SIP scenario
     |
     +------> Asterisk
     |
     +------> Rust engine
```

Compare:

- SIP responses;
- timing where meaningful;
- resulting call state;
- negotiated codec;
- media behavior;
- hangup behavior.

Differences should be understood rather than automatically considered bugs.

---

# 41. Load Testing

Load testing should independently evaluate:

- calls per second;
- concurrent calls;
- RTP packets per second;
- WebSocket throughput;
- memory per call;
- CPU per call.

Test scenarios should include:

```text
1,000 concurrent calls
5,000 concurrent calls
10,000 concurrent calls
```

Actual production targets should be based on expected deployment sizes.

---

# 42. Memory Testing

One of the project's main reasons for existence is predictable memory behavior.

Measure:

- idle memory;
- memory per active call;
- memory per active RTP stream;
- peak memory during call setup bursts;
- memory after calls terminate;
- memory after repeated connect/disconnect cycles.

Long-running soak tests must confirm memory returns to a stable baseline.

---

# 43. Performance Philosophy

Correctness and interoperability take priority over micro-optimizations.

Avoid premature optimization of call-control code.

Optimize the media path where profiling demonstrates benefit.

Prefer:

- bounded buffers;
- buffer reuse;
- minimal copying;
- batched telemetry;
- efficient socket handling.

Do not introduce unsafe code purely for speculative performance gains.

---

# 44. Proposed Crate / Module Layout

An initial workspace may look like:

```text
telephony/
├── crates/
│   ├── sip-types/
│   ├── sip-parser/
│   ├── sip-transport/
│   ├── sip-transaction/
│   ├── sip-dialog/
│   ├── sdp/
│   ├── rtp/
│   ├── rtcp/
│   ├── dtmf/
│   ├── media-core/
│   ├── call-core/
│   ├── provider-profiles/
│   ├── api/
│   ├── events/

├── fuzz/
├── tests/
│   ├── fixtures/
│   ├── pcaps/
│   ├── sipp/
│   └── interoperability/
└── docs/
```

This is illustrative, not mandatory.

Avoid creating dozens of crates without meaningful isolation boundaries.

---

# 45. Dependency Policy

Dependencies in network-facing code should receive additional scrutiny.

Before adopting a dependency, evaluate:

- maintenance activity;
- security history;
- amount of unsafe code;
- transitive dependencies;
- protocol correctness;
- fuzzing coverage;
- license;
- project longevity.

Use existing Rust SIP/RTP libraries only after evaluating whether their architecture and safety properties match our requirements.

Do not choose a library solely to reduce initial implementation work.

---

# 46. Migration Strategy

A big-bang migration is explicitly prohibited.

The transition should happen incrementally.

---

## Phase 0 — Document Current Asterisk Usage

Before implementation, inventory exactly which Asterisk features production currently uses.

For every call flow, document:

- SIP provider;
- inbound/outbound;
- transport;
- authentication;
- SIP methods observed;
- codecs;
- DTMF method;
- early media behavior;
- transfers;
- recordings;
- NAT configuration;
- dialplan functionality;
- ARI/AMI/AGI dependencies;
- external hooks;
- RTP topology.

Deliverable:

```text
docs/current-asterisk-surface.md
```

This document determines the actual Rust scope.

---

## Phase 1 — Media Engine

Implement the Rust media subsystem while Asterisk continues to manage SIP signaling.

Target:

```text
Carrier
   |
   v
Asterisk
   |
   v
Rust Media Core
   |
   v
AI Voice Runtime
```

Objectives:

- prove RTP handling;
- prove audio streaming;
- measure memory;
- validate DTMF;
- validate recordings;
- validate AI backpressure.

Asterisk remains responsible for SIP interoperability.

---

## Phase 2 — SIP Edge in Shadow Mode

Introduce the Rust SIP stack without making it authoritative for production calls.

Possible methods:

- mirrored traffic;
- sanitized production replays;
- SIPp scenarios;
- packet capture replays.

Compare behavior against Asterisk.

---

## Phase 3 — Limited Production SIP

Route a small percentage or specific provider/test number through Rust.

Architecture:

```text
              +--> Rust SIP + RTP
Carrier ------+
              +--> Asterisk
```

Asterisk remains the fallback.

Start with the simplest provider and call flow.

---

## Phase 4 — Expand Provider Coverage

Gradually enable:

- additional providers;
- outbound calling;
- transfers;
- more codecs;
- more complex signaling.

Each new provider must have an interoperability test suite before production migration.

---

## Phase 5 — Rust as Primary Engine

Target architecture:

```text
Carrier
   |
   v
Rust SIP Core
   |
   v
Rust Media Core
   |
   v
AI Voice Platform
```

Asterisk remains available only for explicit legacy/compatibility paths.

---

## Phase 6 — Remove Asterisk Dependency Where Appropriate

Do not remove Asterisk merely to declare the rewrite complete.

Remove it from a call path only after:

- equivalent production behavior is proven;
- rollback exists;
- required telemetry exists;
- provider compatibility tests exist;
- load tests pass;
- soak tests pass.

---

# 47. Rollback Requirement

Every migration stage must support rapid routing back to Asterisk.

The fallback should not require deploying new code.

Prefer configuration or routing-level rollback.

Example:

```text
provider-a:
    engine: rust
```

can become:

```text
provider-a:
    engine: asterisk
```

through controlled configuration.

---

# 49. Definition of Done for v1

Version 1 is considered complete when the engine can reliably:

1. receive inbound SIP calls;
2. originate outbound SIP calls;
3. support UDP and TCP SIP;
4. authenticate to required providers;
5. negotiate G.711 audio;
6. send and receive RTP;
7. detect and send DTMF;
8. stream bidirectional audio to an AI service;
9. handle early media required by our providers;
10. handle CANCEL and BYE correctly;
11. expose call-control APIs;
12. expose lifecycle events;
13. record calls when requested;
14. bridge to a human destination;
15. report useful SIP and RTP diagnostics;
16. survive malformed network traffic without process crashes;
17. operate under configured memory/resource limits;
18. pass the provider compatibility suite;
19. pass defined load and soak tests;
20. support immediate fallback to Asterisk.

---

# 50. Reliability Targets

Exact SLOs should be finalized from production requirements, but the architecture should target:

- no process-wide failure caused by a single malformed call;
- no unbounded per-call memory growth;
- graceful recovery from downstream AI disconnects;
- graceful handling of remote SIP timeouts;
- deterministic call cleanup;
- reliable resource reclamation after call completion;
- horizontally scalable deployment.

---

# 51. Security Acceptance Criteria

Before production:

- SIP parser fuzzing is operational;
- SDP parser fuzzing is operational;
- RTP parser fuzzing is operational;
- dependency vulnerability scanning exists;
- secrets are redacted from logs;
- SIP authentication rate limiting exists;
- external API authentication exists;
- malformed packets cannot panic the process;
- resource limits have been load tested;
- unsafe Rust has been reviewed;
- TLS configuration has been reviewed where enabled.

---

# 52. CI Requirements

Every pull request should run:

```text
cargo fmt --check
cargo clippy
cargo test
```

Additionally:

- parser unit tests;
- state-machine tests;
- integration tests;
- protocol fixture tests.

Scheduled or dedicated CI should run:

- fuzzing;
- SIPp interoperability;
- load tests;
- long-duration soak tests;
- dependency/security audits.

---

# 53. Engineering Rules

The following rules apply throughout implementation.

### Rule 1

Never panic on untrusted network input.

### Rule 2

Never allow unbounded queues.

### Rule 3

Never use SIP Call-ID as our application call ID.

### Rule 4

Never add Asterisk functionality merely for feature parity.

### Rule 5

Every provider-specific workaround requires a regression test.

### Rule 6

Every protocol parser must have fuzz coverage.

### Rule 7

Every call must have enough telemetry to diagnose its lifecycle.

### Rule 8

Keep SIP signaling, media, and AI business logic separate.

### Rule 9

Unsafe code requires explicit justification and review.

### Rule 10

Asterisk remains the production fallback until the Rust path proves equivalent reliability for the required workload.

---

# 54. Architecture Decision Guidance

When evaluating implementation options, prioritize in this order:

1. protocol correctness;
2. interoperability;
3. memory safety;
4. operational reliability;
5. observability;
6. maintainability;
7. performance;
8. feature breadth.

The engine does not need to win SIP benchmarks while losing calls.

---

# 55. Success Criteria

The project succeeds if we end up with a telephony component that is:

**Smaller than Asterisk**

because it implements our actual product requirements.

**Safer than the current C-based network-facing stack**

because protocol handling is primarily memory-safe Rust.

**More programmable**

because call behavior is controlled by APIs and events rather than PBX dialplans.

**Better suited to AI voice**

because streaming media, backpressure, observability, and AI handoff are first-class concepts.

**Operationally replaceable**

because Asterisk remains available as a fallback throughout migration.

**Testable**

because provider behavior is captured through fixtures, PCAPs, SIPp scenarios, differential tests, fuzzing, and state-machine tests.

---

# 56. Final Product Boundary

The Rust engine owns:

```text
SIP
SDP
RTP
RTCP
DTMF
call state
media state
bridging
basic recording
provider interoperability
telephony APIs
telephony events
```

The Rust engine does **not** own:

```text
STT
LLMs
TTS
agent prompts
appointment logic
business workflows
customer CRM logic
billing
clinical logic
general application state
```

These systems integrate with the telephony engine through stable APIs and media interfaces.

---

# 57. Team Directive

Do not start by translating Asterisk C code into Rust.

Start by documenting the exact production call flows and protocol behaviors that must be supported.

Then implement the smallest standards-compliant engine capable of those flows.

Use Asterisk as:

- the current production system;
- a compatibility reference;
- an interoperability oracle;
- a fallback during rollout.

The long-term target is not to recreate Asterisk.

The long-term target is to remove the need for Asterisk from the AI voice call paths where a smaller, safer, purpose-built Rust telephony engine is the better system.

---

# 58. Progress Ledger and Resume Checkpoint

This file is also the execution ledger for the goal. It is the durable handoff point for a later session, agent, or recovery after a crash. The checkpoint at the top of this file and the append-only checkpoint log below must describe the latest known state.

## 58.1 Update Rules

Update this file:

1. at the start of a work session, after inspecting the repository and active worktree;
2. before a risky or externally visible operation;
3. after each meaningful implementation unit, test run, commit, PR update, or deployment decision;
4. immediately when work is blocked, a command fails, or a session is interrupted;
5. before stopping for any reason.

Checkpoint updates must be committed to the active branch with the related work. Push the checkpoint commit when the branch has a remote so a crash or lost worktree does not lose the recovery state. Do not claim a deliverable is complete without recording its evidence.

Use only these status values:

```text
not_started
in_progress
blocked
complete
deferred
not_applicable
```

Do not delete old checkpoint entries. If the recorded state differs from the repository, remote branch, PR, or CI, add a reconciliation entry and correct the header before continuing.

## 58.2 Required Checkpoint Fields

Every checkpoint entry must include:

```text
checkpoint_id: CP-<number>
recorded_at_utc: <ISO-8601 timestamp>
status: <one status value>
phase: <migration phase>
milestone: <milestone>
scope: <small, concrete unit of work>
worktree: <absolute path or none>
branch: <branch name or none>
base_branch: <PR base branch or none>
pr: <number/URL or none>
head_sha: <commit SHA or none>
evidence: <tests, fixtures, CI, review, or runtime evidence>
blockers: <none or precise blocker>
next_action: <single next action>
rollback: <how to route back to Asterisk, or not_applicable>
```

The `next_action` must be executable by the next session without relying on conversational context. If several actions are needed, record only the first and put the remaining ordered actions in `notes`.

## 58.3 Migration Progress Ledger

Keep this table current. Link each completed row to checkpoint IDs, commits, PRs, and test evidence.

| Workstream | Status | Evidence / checkpoint | PR | Next action |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Phase 0 — current Asterisk surface | in_progress | CP-000; no implementation evidence yet | — | Inventory providers, call flows, methods, codecs, DTMF, transfers, recordings, NAT, and external hooks |
| Phase 1 — Rust media engine | not_started | — | — | Define media-core scope from the Phase 0 inventory |
| Phase 2 — SIP edge shadow mode | not_started | — | — | Build sanitized replay and comparison fixtures |
| Phase 3 — limited production SIP | not_started | — | — | Define the first provider/test-number canary and rollback switch |
| Phase 4 — expanded provider coverage | not_started | — | — | Add one provider compatibility suite per rollout target |
| Phase 5 — Rust primary engine | not_started | — | — | Confirm production SLO, telemetry, and rollback gates |
| Phase 6 — remove Asterisk where appropriate | not_started | — | — | Prove equivalent behavior before removing each call path |

## 58.4 Checkpoint Log

Append one record per state change. Keep the newest record at the bottom.

### CP-000 — Initial goal capture

```yaml
checkpoint_id: CP-000
recorded_at_utc: 2026-08-30
status: in_progress
phase: Phase 0 — Document Current Asterisk Usage
milestone: Milestone 1 — Scope Baseline
scope: Establish the implementation scope and recovery ledger
worktree: none
branch: aistack/main
base_branch: aistack/main
pr: none
head_sha: not recorded
evidence: goal.md created; no implementation work recorded
blockers: none
next_action: Inventory production call flows, providers, and the current Asterisk surface
rollback: not_applicable
```

### Checkpoint template

Copy this template, assign the next checkpoint ID, fill every field, and append it after each meaningful state change:

```yaml
checkpoint_id: CP-<next>
recorded_at_utc: <timestamp>
status: <status>
phase: <phase>
milestone: <milestone>
scope: <scope>
worktree: <absolute path>
branch: <branch>
base_branch: <base>
pr: <PR number/URL>
head_sha: <SHA>
evidence: <commands and results, fixture IDs, CI links, or runtime evidence>
blockers: <none or blocker>
next_action: <single executable action>
rollback: <fallback action>
notes: <optional ordered follow-up actions or reconciliation details>
```

## 58.5 Resume Procedure

When this goal is resumed:

1. Read the header, migration progress ledger, and newest checkpoint entry before changing code.
2. Inspect current state with `git status --short --branch`, `git log -1 --oneline`, `git worktree list --porcelain`, and the relevant remote/PR state.
3. Match the recorded worktree, branch, base branch, PR, and `head_sha` to the inspected state. Treat a mismatch as `reconciliation_required`; do not overwrite work or assume the checkpoint is current.
4. Re-run the failed command or inspect the recorded blocker before starting a new unit of work.
5. Continue the recorded `next_action` in the recorded worktree and PR stack position. Do not repeat completed work unless new evidence invalidates it.
6. Record a new checkpoint after reconciliation, progress, failure, or interruption, then commit it before stopping.

If the original worktree no longer exists, locate the registered worktree by branch and PR, recreate it only under `~/.worktrees/w3mirror/asterisk/*`, and record the new path plus the old path in a reconciliation checkpoint.

# 59. Stacked PR and Worktree Delivery Policy

This migration must be delivered through GitHub's multiple stacked pull request workflow. Each PR must be independently understandable, narrowly scoped, testable, and safe to pause or roll back.

## 59.1 Stack Order and Bases

- The first PR in the stack targets `aistack/main`.
- Every subsequent PR targets the immediately preceding PR branch, not `aistack/main` directly.
- Keep the stack ordered from foundational protocol/types work to media, call control, APIs, interoperability, and production rollout.
- Record the stack order, PR number, branch, base branch, head SHA, CI state, and checkpoint IDs in this file.
- Do not merge or rebase a downstream PR silently. When an upstream PR changes, update downstream branches/worktrees in stack order and record the resulting SHAs.
- Keep Asterisk routing fallback available at every stack stage; a PR is not rollout-complete merely because it merged.

## 59.2 Worktree Location and Creation

Every branch in this migration must have its own non-detached worktree below:

```text
~/.worktrees/w3mirror/asterisk/*
```

Use a stable path such as `~/.worktrees/w3mirror/asterisk/pr-<number>-<slug>`. Do not create migration branches in the repository checkout, in another worktree root, or in a detached-HEAD worktree.

Create tracked local branches with the `--track -b` form. For an already-published branch:

```sh
git worktree add ~/.worktrees/w3mirror/asterisk/pr-<number>-<slug> --track -b <branch-name> origin/<branch-name>
```

For the first new stack branch, base it explicitly on `origin/aistack/main` while still creating a local branch in the worktree:

```sh
git worktree add ~/.worktrees/w3mirror/asterisk/pr-01-<slug> --track -b <branch-name> origin/aistack/main
```

Never use `git worktree add <path> origin/<branch>` without `-b` and `--track`, because that creates a detached worktree and breaks resumability.

## 59.3 PR Stack Ledger

Populate one row per PR before implementation begins, then update it at every checkpoint:

| Order | PR | Branch | Base / target | Worktree | Scope | Status | Head SHA | CI / evidence | Next action |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | TBD | `<branch-1>` | `aistack/main` | `~/.worktrees/w3mirror/asterisk/pr-01-<slug>` | First independently reviewable foundation slice | not_started | — | — | Define scope from Phase 0 inventory |
| 2+ | TBD | `<branch-n>` | `<immediately preceding branch>` | `~/.worktrees/w3mirror/asterisk/pr-<n>-<slug>` | One bounded follow-on slice | not_started | — | — | Add only after the preceding slice has a stable contract |

## 59.4 Stacked-PR Checkpoints

Each PR should leave a green checkpoint before the next PR depends on it:

- scope and acceptance criteria recorded;
- worktree path and branch/base relationship recorded;
- focused tests and formatting/lint results recorded;
- commit SHA and PR/CI state recorded;
- known failures separated from regressions;
- rollback or Asterisk fallback recorded;
- next PR's starting commit and base branch recorded.

If work stops or crashes, resume the lowest incomplete PR in stack order, using its newest checkpoint and verified worktree/head SHA. Do not jump to a downstream PR while its base is unreconciled.
